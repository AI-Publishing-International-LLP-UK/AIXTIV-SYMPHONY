        "According to a recent study by Google, 80% of those surveyed believe platform engineering is key to the future of AI. We can already see how AI is rapidly transforming how enterprises approach technology, but managing the complexity of AI infrastructure remains a significant challenge. While AI accelerates innovation, it doesn't eliminate complexity, it simply shifts it. Only with a solid platform foundation can AI initiatives scale successfully without overwhelming your engineering teams with new tooling and infrastructure demands.",
        "Join us for a hands-on workshop where you'll build a Minimum Viable Platform (MVP) from scratch with Humanitec. Learn how to set up a simple app with key dependencies like DNS, database, and a messaging queue while efficiently connecting your cluster, and configuring essential resources.",
        "Many organizations assume that adding Backstage to their infrastructure is enough to create a complete, and successful Internal Developer Platform. While Backstage can be a useful starting point, it alone isn't enough to realize the full potential of platform engineering. A true IDP requires more than just a frontend, it needs a robust, well-structured backend to deliver real value."

        "The main reason to build an MVP is because when starting their Internal Developer Platform (IDP) journey, most businesses fall into the trap of trying to solve all their problems at once.
