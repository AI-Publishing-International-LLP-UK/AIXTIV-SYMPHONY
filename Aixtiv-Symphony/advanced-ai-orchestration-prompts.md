## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE

### Integration with AIXTIV-Symphony Architecture

**Diamond SAO Command Center Integration:**
```bash
# Access templates via Diamond CLI
diamond prompt-library --template retail_intelligence
diamond orchestrate --template enterprise_transformation --voice-profile "Dr. Lucy sRIX"
diamond launch --multi-template --vertical investor --output voice+json
```

**Voice Synthesis Requirements:**
- All templates use computational smooth voices only (no TTS)
- ElevenLabs integration with specified sRIX voice profiles
- Gentle pauses and emphasis patterns for complex concepts
- Context-aware voice adaptation based on stakeholder audience

**MCP Routing Implementation:**
Each template includes MCP routing headers for proper client segmentation:
- Retail clients route to `/retail/*` endpoints
- Enterprise clients access `/enterprise/*` services  
- Investor relations utilize `/investor/*` specialized services

**Security & Compliance:**
- All templates reference secrets via Google Secret Manager variables
- OAuth2 authentication required for enterprise and investor templates
- SAO tier validation ensures appropriate access control
- Audit logging for all prompt executions and outcomes

### Usage Examples

**Retail Intelligence Deployment:**
```javascript
const retailIntelligence = await diamond.orchestrate({
  template: 'quantum_retail_intelligence',
  data: retailDataPayload,
  voice: 'Dr. Lucy sRIX',
  output: ['json', 'voice_synthesis', 'dashboard']
});
```

**Enterprise Risk Assessment:**
```javascript
const securityAssessment = await diamond.orchestrate({
  template: 'security_compliance_sentinel', 
  context: enterpriseContext,
  voice: 'Dr. Burby sRIX',
  stakeholders: ['CISO', 'Board', 'Audit_Committee']
});
```

**Investor Alpha Discovery:**
```javascript  
const alphaOpportunities = await diamond.orchestrate({
  template: 'alternative_alpha_hunter',
  market_data: alternativeMarketsData,
  voice: 'Dr. Maria sRIX', 
  risk_parameters: portfolioRiskBudget
});
```

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Deploy Templates**: Integrate these 15 templates into your AIXTIV-Symphony production environment
2. **Voice Profile Testing**: Validate ElevenLabs integration with each specified sRIX voice profile  
3. **Security Validation**: Confirm OAuth2 and Secret Manager integration for enterprise/investor templates
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Implement analytics tracking for template effectiveness and user satisfaction
5. **Continuous Optimization**: Use feedback loops to refine templates based on real-world performance data
