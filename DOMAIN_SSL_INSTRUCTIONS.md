# Dr. Claude Orchestrator: Domain SSL Configuration Guide

## SSL Fix for asoos.2100.cool

This guide provides instructions for fixing the SSL certificate issue with the asoos.2100.cool domain.

## DNS Configuration

Add the following DNS records to your domain registrar for asoos.2100.cool:

```
# A record pointing to Firebase hosting
A @ 151.101.1.195

# A record for subdomain
A asoos 151.101.1.195

# CNAME for www
CNAME www asoos-2100-cool.web.app

# TXT record for verification
TXT @ google-site-verification=firebase1234567890
```

## Firebase Site Creation (When Quota Resets)

Once your daily quota resets, run the following commands:

```bash
# Create the site
firebase hosting:sites:create asoos-2100-cool --project api-for-warp-drive

# Connect the domain
firebase hosting:sites:update asoos-2100-cool --project api-for-warp-drive --domains=asoos.2100.cool
```

## Automatic Verification with Dr. Claude Orchestrator

The Dr. Claude Orchestrator system can automatically monitor and fix domain verification issues. To enable this for all domains:

1. Create a file `domains/active-domains.txt` with all domains to monitor, one per line
2. Run the batch SSL manager: `node batch-domain-ssl-manager.js`
3. Add generated DNS records to your domain registrar
4. The system will automatically retry domains that hit quota limits

## Verification Process

1. After adding DNS records, Firebase will automatically verify the domain
2. Once verified, an SSL certificate will be provisioned
3. This process typically takes 24-48 hours to complete

## Testing SSL Certificate

To check if the SSL certificate has been properly provisioned:

```bash
curl -v https://asoos.2100.cool
```

If you see "SSL certificate verify ok" in the output, the certificate is working properly.

## Troubleshooting

If you still see the "Your connection is not private" error after 48 hours:

1. Verify DNS records are correctly configured
2. Check the site in Firebase console: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/api-for-warp-drive/hosting/sites
3. Manually trigger verification in Firebase console

## Automatic Scaling Support

The Dr. Claude Orchestrator's domain verification system supports autoscaling by automatically verifying domains during scaling events. This ensures new domains are properly secured without manual intervention.
